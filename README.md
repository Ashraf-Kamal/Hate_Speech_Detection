# HCovBi-Caps for Hate Speech Detection

This repository contains the implementation of the HCovBi-Caps model for detecting hate speech. It is an end-to-end deep learning based model which leverge the effectiveness of contextual information at the different orientations of the input data. It consists of an input, embedding, convolution, BiGRU, capsule network, dense, and output layers. The proposed model is evaluated over two benchmark datasets and demonstrated a significantly better performance than the existing state-of-the-art and deep learning based baseline methods.
